# Object and Array Destructuring
Destructuring is javascript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects and maps and set them into new, distinct variables.

## Atleast for object destructing into distinct variables, position doesn't matter as long as object have properties with the same name of distinct variable it will fetch its approprite value

if distinct variable name and properties names are in object mismatch it will return undefined for that variables


## But in case of Array destructuring is different in a way, because as array's indexed with indexed number not key's of string as in case of object proper position matters to exact element from array destructing.


## Destructuring an object from return statement from an function call is same as function call
